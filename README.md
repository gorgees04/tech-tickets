# Teck Tickets App

**[LIVE DEMO](https://tech-tickets.vercel.app/)**

# Description

The Teck Tickets app is a website designed to facilitate the creation, display, editing, and deletion of tickets through the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Additionally, when a ticket is resolved, it will be moved to a separate section known as the "solved" page, where solved tickets are stored in a distinct table. This functionality is achieved by utilizing React for the frontend and a NoSQL MongoDB database for the backend.
